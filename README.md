Implementations of shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra) in MATLAB and Python

This code implements Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix where non-existent edges are assigned inf. The algorithm iteratively selects the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, then updates the distances to its neighbors. The final result is a list of shortest distances from the start node to every other node in the network.
